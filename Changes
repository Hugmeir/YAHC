Revision history for Perl module YAHC

0.027 2016-07-16 IKRUGLOV
    - new backoff_delay feature
    - new lifetime_timeout feature
    - *change in behaivor* - in case of internal error, exception in
      callback or expiration of lifetime_timeout callback is called with
      TERMINAL_ERROR bit set in $error. In this case all further attempt to
      retry or reinit connection are ignored and the connection goes to
      COMPLETED state unconditionally. Previous behaivor was that a connection
      silently terminates.
    - *change in behaivor* - give all timeouts the highest priorities in event
      loop. This provides stonger timeout guarantee but can cause timeouts in
      border cases which didn't happen before.
    - *change in behaivor* - when connection failed all retry attempts report
      error condition with new error YAHC::Error::RETRY_LIMIT instead of
      YAHC::Error::CONNECT_ERROR
    - rename YAHC::State::WAIT_SYNACK to YAHC::State::CONNECTING
